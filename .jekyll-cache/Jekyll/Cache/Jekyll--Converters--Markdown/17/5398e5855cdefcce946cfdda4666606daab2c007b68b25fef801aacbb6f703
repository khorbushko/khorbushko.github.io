  <li><strong>BLE</strong>- Bluetooth Low</li>
  <li><strong>PCB</strong> — Printed circuit board</li>
  <li><strong>API</strong> — Application Programming Interface</li>

<p>Every developer who worked with iOS BLE knows that not everything is so good as it’s described in the documentation. And today, I would like to describe a few main points that can be tricky when working with BLE.
