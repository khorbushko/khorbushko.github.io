<p>Every developer who worked with iOS BLE knows that not everything is so good as itâ€™s described in the documentation. And today, I would like to describe a few main points that can be tricky when working with BLE. I would like to provide some information for you, reader and I guess BLE-developer, to make your journey in Cocoa BLE world less painful and more productive.</p>
