<p>Every developer who worked with iOS BLE knows that not everything is so good as it‚Äôs described in the documentation. And today, I would like to describe a few main points that can be tricky when working with BLE. I would like to provide some information for you, reader and I guess BLE-developer, to make your journey in Cocoa BLE world less painful and more productive.

<p>So, the very first thing you need to know is the answer to the question ‚ÄùWhere exactly something goes wrong ‚Äî on my side or on the connected device? Does something happen when I send a command to the device?‚Äù</p>

<p>To get an answer to this question I recommend to use a few approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sniffer tool</li>
  <li>3rd party apps for testing API</li>
  <li>logging</li>
  <li>firmware version of the device, with which you work without encryption or any other protection</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let‚Äôs discuss every point more details.</p>

<h2 id="sniffer-tool">Sniffer tool</h2>

<p><strong>Sniffer tool</strong> ‚Äî this a tool that allows you to intersect data packets and analyze them without a CoreBluetooth framework. It can be very helpful to distinguish different aspects of BLE communication ‚Äî requests, responses, unhandled error, unexpected messages, etc. To set up such tool, you basically need several things: special Ppcband firmware Mac. I used Wireshark and Nordic Semiconductors test board. Together they provide a powerful toolset for sniffing activities.</p>

<p>Sniffer tools can be used in two modes ‚Äî advertisement and connection.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="3rd-party-apps-for-testing-api">3rd party apps for testing API</h2>

<p>3rd party apps for testing API ‚Äî one of the fastest ways to test your device is to use 3rd party solutions. With such products, you can easily scan, discover, send/receive, or even simulate some functionality of your device.</p>

<p>Great examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightblue-explorer/id557428110?mt=8">LightBlue</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silicon-labs-blue-gecko-wstk/id1030932759?mt=8">BlueGecko</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>

<p>Logging ‚Äî most BLE devices talk to a smartphone on the other end. Because of this, understanding what‚Äôs happening on the phone itself can be critical. One of the most useful techniques for checking what‚Äôs happening on the phone is to use the operating system‚Äôs own logging capabilities.</p>

<p>In iOS, enabling Bluetooth logging requires installing a special profile in the device. You can find more information on enabling it at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/">link</a></p>

<p>Once enabled, iTunes can sync the logs to a computer and they can be analyzed.</p>

<h2 id="firmware">Firmware</h2>

<p>Firmware ‚Äî to protect own product it‚Äôs common to use an encrypted protocol of communication between app and device. Such approach ensures a higher security level for a user, but at the same time is much harder in terms of development. To simplify this process, always use an unencrypted version of firmware during development and include an additional level of security only for production purposes. This, of course, affects firmware development time a little bit, but this also reduces efforts required from your side to develop a great app using such firmware.</p>

<p>At this point, I assume that development environment is up and running, and all you need is just to make your hands dirty and write some code to bring life to the app :).</p>

<p>Now, to make sure your user gets best UX you should fully control all processes inside your app and, correspondingly, all aspects of it. Basically, you should think about the following points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bluetooth device availability (status observation)</li>
  <li>timeout for from the connected device</li>
  <li>multiline response handling (if needed)</li>
  <li>backgrounding (if needed)</li>
  <li>multi-device connection (if needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>I won‚Äôt describe all aspects of each point in the list above, instead, I will give you some advice for them.</p>
