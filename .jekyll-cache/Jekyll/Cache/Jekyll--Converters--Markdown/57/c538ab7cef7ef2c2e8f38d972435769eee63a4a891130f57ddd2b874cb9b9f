<p>Every developer who worked with iOS BLE knows that not everything is so good as it’s described in the documentation. And today, I would like to describe a few main points that can be tricky when working with BLE. I would like to provide some information for you, reader and I guess BLE-developer, to make your journey in Cocoa BLE world less painful and more productive.</p>

<p>So, the very first thing you need to know is the answer to the question ”Where exactly something goes wrong — on my side or on the connected device? Does something happen when I send a command to the device?”</p>

<p>To get an answer to this question I recommend to use a few approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sniffer tool</li>
  <li>3rd party apps for testing API</li>
  <li>logging</li>
  <li>firmware version of the device, with which you work without encryption or any other protection</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s discuss every point more details.</p>

<h2 id="sniffer-tool">Sniffer tool</h2>

<p><strong>Sniffer tool</strong> — this a tool that allows you to intersect data packets and analyze them without a CoreBluetooth framework. It can be very helpful to distinguish different aspects of BLE communication — requests, responses, unhandled error, unexpected messages, etc. To set up such tool, you basically need several things: special Ppcband firmware Mac. I used Wireshark and Nordic Semiconductors test board. Together they provide a powerful toolset for sniffing activities.</p>

<p>Sniffer tools can be used in two modes — advertisement and connection.</p>
