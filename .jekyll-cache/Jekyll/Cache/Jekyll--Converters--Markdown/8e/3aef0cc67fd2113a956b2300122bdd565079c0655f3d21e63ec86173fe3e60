<p>How many times do we need to change something in standard components supplied by Apple? Well, quite often, so I guess everything should be done keeping this simple thing in mind. But letâ€™s check <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NavigationBar</code> in SwiftUI.</p>

<p>â€œOh crap!â€ - u can say after the first 10 min of testing and trying to change something - it wonâ€™t be easy to customize that :(. So today I want to tell u about my experience related to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NavigationBar</code> customization in SwiftUI.</p>
