In the last few articles, I covered the intro theme related to [BeagleboneÂ® Blue](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beaglebone-blue). So for now, we already have configured connection to the board and Eclipse installed and configured for cross-compile process. But what we want - is an option to debug in real-time, reviewing and examining variables and executing commands.
<!--more-->

To achieve this, we still need to cover a few more points:

- configure gdbserver on board
- configure remote connection for debugging in Eclipse

## gdbserver

[gdbserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdbserver) is specially designed for remote debugging. This set of tools is needed so we can perform our remote debug.

To install [gdbserver pckg](https://packages.debian.org/buster/gdbserver) on the board we have (as always) a few options:

- connect the board to the internet (as described in [prev]({% post_url 2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup %}) posts) and execute the command. In our case, [armhf version](https://packages.debian.org/buster/armhf/gdbserver/download) will be installed with all dependencies.
- without an internet connection, things become a bit more interesting - u need to manually download this pckg with all dependencies. 

### Installing using an internet connection

In this case, we simply run 1 command:

```
sudo apt-get update // optionally
sudo apt-get install gdbserver
```

> `-y` option can be used to bypass all questions with confirmation

to check:

```
gdbserver --version
```

done. :]

### installing offline

In this case, we should download all packages manually - all dependencies should be downloaded with the correct versions. This looks like a bit tricky process, but with [debian package description ](https://packages.debian.org/buster/gdbserver) this can be done quite quickly.

We also can use some nice [script](https://github.com/yusuphwickama/wickerscripts/blob/master/Shell/pkgdownload), that does all the hard work for us.

> Note: pkgdownload will download pckgs for u'r current architecture

Unfortunately - this script does not support downloading for the different arch, we can either use it for finding references or apply a few changes and use it.

Now, just install all packages on the board

```
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```
> `-i` means install

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/install gdbserver manually.png">

</div>
<br>
<br>

if everything is done correctly, u can now check the gdbserver

<div style="text-align:center">

</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

done.

## Configuring Eclipse

To properly configure remote debugging we need to do a few things:

- create a project (as we did in [this post]({% post_url 2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup %}))
- configure remote target for debugging

### Create a project

In the last post I covered how to create and configure project [`helloWorldonBBB`]({% post_url 2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup %})).

Now we have our toolchain configured and ready:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/toolchain.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/toolchain.png" alt="toolchain" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

It's time for Eclipse Remote Connection Setup.

We already have connected ssh to our board and remote explorer configuration.

> assumed that u also created a dedicated user on board for debugging purposes. 
```
sudo useradd -r -d /home/debugger -m -s /bin/bash -c "Debugger" -G dialout,i2c,spi,cdrom,floppy,audio,video,plugdev,users,sudo,gpio,pwm,kmem debugger # Some of these groups may not be necessary.
sudo passwd debugger
```
> u may also want to modify `/etc/sudoers.d/debugger ` to allow some `sudo` commands

Now it's time to create a new debug target. To do so, on the Eclipse Run menu, select **Run Configurations** -> **C/C++ Remote Application**, and choose **New launch configuration** at the top left corner.

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/new run config.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/new run config.png" alt="new run config" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Now, we should configure our target, by specifying a project, application, and absolute path to the target on the board (where our binary will be placed):

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/remote debug target.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/remote debug target.png" alt="remote debug target" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

We also may need to configure commands before running - in this case, I added a command for setting execute permission to file, so gdbserver was able to run it and connect:

```
chmod +x /home/debugger/install/testBuild/helloWorldonBBB
```

We also should update our debugger config - so we become able to correctly understand symbols received from binary:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/remote debug target debugger.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/remote debug target debugger.png" alt="remote debug target debugger" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Here we just updated the path to the debugger - in my case [multiarch](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO) one

```
/usr/bin/gdb-multiarch
```

[`.gdbinit`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/gdbinit.5.html) file I didn't change, but u can update it and add u'r own commands and other needed stuff there.

Last, but not least stuff - we should create a connection, a way how the eclipse will connect to the target:

Select **New** near **Connection**, choose type **SSH**, and enter the address and the port, as well as the Hostname. Select **Public key-based authentication** and click on **Keys are set at Network Connections, SSH2** to specify the previously configured SSH key. finally press **Finish**.

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/connection.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/connection.png" alt="connection" width="400"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

U now should be able to press **Browse** - and navigate through the file system on the remote device.

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/hello from BBB.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/hello from BBB.png" alt="browse files" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/browse files.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/browse files.png" alt="browse files" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

U may also include some arguments that will be run within your app, for example `--verbose`. Off cause u need to implement this on your own in the app u develop.

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/arguments.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/arguments.png" alt="arguments" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

And the last thing - let's add [launch target](https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/LaunchBar#Launch_Target) - a machine that the launch will run on. On the toolbar select **New Launch Target** -> Select the type of target to create as **GDB Remote TCP** -> **Next** -> **Enter the connection information for gdb remote connection**: hostname and a port -> **Finish**

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/launch target-1.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/launch target-1.png" alt="launch target" width="300"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/launch target-2.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/launch target-2.png" alt="launch target" width="300"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Now we are ready to run the app on a remote host in debug mode.

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/debug.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-16-Beaglebone Blue - remote debug/debug.png" alt="debug" width="600"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Now we can debug our remote app with Eclipse!

## Alternative way

We can also skip this configuration and try to build the app on the board using for example [cmake](https://cmake.org) vs [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) or another approach. In this case, live debugging can be done via [logger](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/observability/debug-logging/) and [console output](https://dev.co/code-debugging#4-Implement-Logging).

## Pitfalls

- If u use some libraries, Eclipse requires by default that the library name start from **lib**, and u specify a name without this prefix. In case the library has no prefix - u can use a colon in the name `:` during linking - aka `:some` - this is the option for linking a non-standard library name. An alternative - is [rebuild using soname](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1305266/how-to-link-to-a-shared-library-without-lib-prefix-in-a-different-directory), if u have such an option. 
- Eclipse does not accept the ed25519 SSH key type. Fix described [here]({% post_url 2024-03-16-SSH vs Eclipse - not a friends anymore? %})
- make sure u link libraries for the linking process compiled and linked for the target architecture, not for u'r system architecture
- some system libraries like `std` or `filesystem` (add `stdc++fs` to linked libs) may not be visible until u select the proper **Cross G++ compiler** - version ISO C++17 (`-std=c++17`) can fix a lot of issues. [How to fix GCC undefined reference to std::experimental::filesystem:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49249349/undefined-reference-when-using-experimental-filesystem) may be also interesting
- make sure that during specifying path for headers add common headers in the **C/C++ Path and Headers** section of project properties instead of **C/C++ Build** and only in selected compiler groups
- if u add flags - add them in proper places in project properties
- some flags to hide warnings are missed, u can add them manually in **Miscellaneous** sections for specific compilers. For example:
```
-pie -Wextra -Werror -Wconversion -pedantic -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Wno-psabi
```
- make sure that `glic` used for building libraries for linking is the same or lower than on installed on the target board - in another case, u will receive the error `unknown reference`.
- use `--verbose` in debug to see detailed problem description
- make sure that the prefix for the selected arch is correct `arm-linux-gnueabihf-` - pay attention to the last symbol!
- use `internal builder` **Builder type** in proj properties
