Recently I got a [BeagleboneÂ® Blue](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beaglebone-blue) board that uses Linux and provides a wide possibilities for u'r creativity. Using this board u can create a lot of stuff and cover wide areas - from home automation to production purposes.

To utilize such a possibility u need to set up a proper environment and IDE that improves u'r productivity. I choose [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and [Linux](https://www.debian.org), thus first is one of the well-known IDEs for embedded development with great support for different tools and last is because of [librobotcontrol](https://github.com/beagleboard/librobotcontrol) library that is written for Linux only os.

In this article, I would like to cover the process of configuring Eclipse for [cross-compile](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Cross_002dCompilation.html) on Beaglebone Blue (BBB).

## Toolchain

I have some experience in work related to cross-compile environments - some time ago I was working with the [open-wrt](https://openwrt.org) platform. This is also a great platform with wide possibilities. The only moment - u need to spend some time correctly configuring the environment. Without some hints sometimes this can be a bit tricky.

In general, everything is quite simple:

- configure [toolchain](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_toolchain) for selected architecture
- Configure Eclipse ide so it can use it
- learn [c/c++](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- write the app and run it on the platform using the exec file

but, as always, the devil is in details. 

I want to cover every step, so the process becomes as simple as possible.

> I also suggest to read a bit about [cmake](https://cmake.org), [makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com) and optionally [ninja](https://ninja-build.org).

So, toolchain. A set of tools. Thus we use a different [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture) on board than one that is used on our PC (mine is macBookPro14,3), we need somehow teach our PC to work with different architecture and to teach to create a proper executable file for it. 

As I mentioned, we will configure the environment for BBB board, BBB board uses [arm-linux-gnueabihf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family) architecture or in short **armhf**.

We should download armhf toolchains. There are many different providers of toolchains. But in general, all of them under the hood use the same tools - gdb, gcc, g++, etc. One such provider - [Linaro](https://www.linaro.org), alternative [Arm](https://www.arm.com).

I use a toolchain from [Linaro](https://www.linaro.org). To download the toolchain - go [to this web page](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/). U can select any from the available version that is suitable for u.

> Note, that there is a pitfall hidden in these files - u should use binary created with a toolchain that uses [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) of the same version or lower than on u'r board, in other cases, u will receive a linking error, about unknown reference for a symbol in glibc of specific version. 

If u need the most fresh build - u can use toolchain from [snapshot](https://snapshots.linaro.org/gnu-toolchain/14.0-2023.06-1/aarch64-linux-gnu/), but u need to be careful, because, as mentioned on this page - **They will break your stuff and drink all your beer. You have been warned**. ;]

Again, the main thing is to get in sync with u'r glibc version in the toolchain with glibc version on board (BBB) and glibc version used to prepare any lib that u use for u'r project (the *.o files).

Ok, so we download the toolchain. Now, let's install it - just unpack the archive to some directory and update u'r path.

```
wget https://releases.linaro.org/<path to selected version>.tar.xz
tar Jxf gcc-linaro-<version>-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
PATH=$(pwd)/gcc-linaro-<version>-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin
```

> U may need [curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) for this - `sudo apt-get install curl`

I did this process using the next commands:

```
wget https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.5-2019.12/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
sudo tar xvf gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz -C /opt/
cd /opt/
sudo mv gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-arm-Linux
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-arm-Linux/bin
```

If u did everything correctly - u can just run the command in the terminal to check the version of installed gcc in the toolchain:

```
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc --version
```

U should get some output like this one:

> arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0
> Copyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
> This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

To check the version of u'r glibc, just run `ldd --version` or `~/<path to arm-none-linux-gnueabi install folder>/libc/usr/bin/ldd --version`.

As alternative way u can use [`apt`](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-apt-command/) command for [installation](https://learn.arm.com/install-guides/gcc/cross/):

```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf -y
```

> `-y` means that u accept any question from the installation process with a YES answer

When u install the toolchain u are ready to build the app, just run `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc  hello-world.c -o hello-world.elf`, but we will review the more comfortable way to do things.

> U may get various failures and errors during this simple process like [this](https://forum.beagleboard.org/t/eclipse-2021-06-remote-debugging-on-bbb/30428/6) one or [this](https://forum.beagleboard.org/t/eclipse-2021-06-remote-debugging-on-bbb/30428/6). Be patient. |].

As an additional step, u may want to configure u'r `apt` for target architecture - so u can download and install the library for the arch that is used on board while still using a different architecture. This is needed if u want to build and link libraries that are used in u'r project. To do so, just execute these commands:

```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crossbuild-essential-armhf
```

This [called](https://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/Cross#Multiarch-Built_.28wdotap.29) and know as [Multiarch](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO).

After this, u can just call a command with an arch suffix to be able to install packages for different architectures.

```
apt-get install package:architecture
```

**Pitfall**: there is a chance, that u may have noted, that the old version of python2.6 is required. This version is old and not available for now. But there is a [workaround](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2486174) exists.

```
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/Python-2.7.9.tgz
sudo tar xzf Python-2.7.9.tgz
cd Python-2.7.9
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall

python2.7 -V
~ Python 2.7.9
sudo ln -sfn '/usr/local/bin/python2.7' '/usr/bin/python2'
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2 

sudo update-alternatives --config python
* 0            /usr/bin/python3   2         auto mode
  1            /usr/bin/python2   1         manual mode
  2            /usr/bin/python3   2         manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number
1
```

There is a great tool here - [`update-alternatives`](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/update-alternatives-command).

## Eclipse IDE

Ok, so our toolchain is ready and waiting for actions from us, but we are still not ready :[. We want to use Eclipse IDE, so our process becomes more comfortable and we can use autocomplete and other nice stuff.

We want to use [Eclipse for C/C++ developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2024-03/r/eclipse-ide-cc-developers). The process is quite simple - just download and install.

Done.

Now we are ready to start.

So, the very first program will be the trivial one - Hello-world ;].

Here is a step-by-step guide:

Open the Eclipse app from the folder where it's installed or by simply running the command from terminal `eclipse`.

> Note: DO NOT USE **`SUDO`** while launch *eclipse* - this is not that u want to do.

Accept or change the suggested Working Folder location. Your projects will be stored there. Note, that u can have a few projects in the same workspace.

Then select File -> New -> Project choose C++ Project and press Next.
Project Name: `helloWorldonBBB`. This must be Empty project, type - **Hello World C++ Project** and **Cross GCC toolchain** selected


<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/1.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/1.png" alt="gcc" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>


Then press Next.

Select both configurations proposed:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/2.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/2.png" alt="gcc" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

then Next-> Next...

When screen with toolchain path appear, put in **Cross-compiler path** as `path to your toolchain` and  **Cross compiler prefix** as `arm-linux-gnueabihf-`:


<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/3.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/3.png" alt="gcc" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Finish.

We also need to update project settings a bit: right-click on the project name -> Properties -> **C/C++ Build -> Builder Settings**. Select **Builder type**: Internal builder then apply and close.

Our app is as simple as possible:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "!!!Hello World BBB!!!" < endl; // prints !!!Hello World BBB!!!
	return 0
}
```

Next action Build -> Build Project

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/4.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/4.png" alt="gcc" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

We can also see the build output:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/5.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/5.png" alt="gcc" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>


As a result, we get out the executable file. We can check its architecture in any available way, for example using `readelf -h <file>`:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/file.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-15-Beaglebone Blue - environment setup/file.png" alt="gcc" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Now we can give execution permission to this file by running:

```
chmod +x helloWorldonBBB
```

copy to the board and run

```
./helloWorldonBBB
```

Done.

## Conclusion

This was a long setup, but we learned a lot. The next step is to prepare remote debug - so we can not only build the app but also debug it from the board in real-time. This will improve the process dramatically. I also will cover the process of initially configuring the BBB board and maybe a few other related topics.
