Testing push notifications sometimes can be a problematic process. In [one of the previous posts]({% post_url 2021-11-13-push-routine %}) I covered base practices and how we can do that. 

Another moment that was covered in that post - I show my dev tool for testing: `pushHandle`. It was a raw tool with limited functionality (only p8 key support) and poor UI. 
<!--more-->

Some time passed and I faced again the need to test push notifications. For this time, I completely redesign the app and add a ton of new functionality:

- [x] Auth with p8 key
- [x] Auth with p12 cert
- [x] Auth with keychain
- [x] Custom push payload
- [x] Payload JSON validation
- [x] Predefined payloads
- [x] Full customization of push
- [x] Build in hints
- [x] Multiply sessions
- [x] Session persistants
- [x] History with detailed info
- [x] Inspection of request with option to use curl for p8 auth
- [x] Rich failure description
- [x] Light/Dark mode
- [x] Written in Swift

All this is combined into the new tool - **Antumbra** - OS X app for sending pushes with Apple Push Notification service (APNs) over HTTP/2 API.

## the app

I decided to make a universal free and open-source tool that covers push notifications test purposes from different prospects.

> The idea was taken originally from [Pusher](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher) app - a great tool, that is not supported anymore. After checking alternatives I found [PushHero](https://onmyway133.com/pushhero/) app - a good one, but u need to pay 15$ for that.

The overall app UI looks like this

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-09-05-antumbra/app_scr_1.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-09-05-antumbra/app_scr_1.png" alt="design" width="600"/>
</a>
</div>

I spend some free time in the evening creating this tool. 

The good source of information was original [Apple posts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/) about push work. I strongly recommend this to u if u want to learn to push in details. unusually detailed posts. 

During creating this tool, I also learn a few new stuff that I haven't work before. The most interesting are:

- work with Security framework and keychain
- an inner structure of certificates
- details of file protection system (sandbox) on macOS

The most interesting one - is working with API from [`Security` framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security). 

Knowledge about keychains and certificates is needed to be able to accomplish a part of the functionality that uses installed certificates for APNS from an inside keychain.

## keychain and certificates

I won't cover all the theory about certificates and keychains here, but here is [the link for doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/certificates) related to this part.

The interesting for our purposes part - is to get the list of certificates and fetch needed details from each entity, later use that to sign our APNS request.

### certificate

The certificate is represented via [`SecCertificate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seccertificate). We then can [ispect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/certificates/examining_a_certificate) the certificate for various values - name, issuer, validity date, etc.

For purpose of this app, I created an object that represents a certificate - `KeychainCertificate`:

```
import Security

struct KeychainCertificate: Equatable, Hashable {
  let certificate: SecCertificate
}
```

Yep, that's easy :).  `SecCertificate` contains all the info we need later. We can check the `SecIdentity` header for convenient methods of getting specific info from the certificate.

The certificate can provide us with different values. For example, to get `SecIdentity`:


{% highlight swift %}
var identity: SecIdentity? {
	var identityInst: SecIdentity?
	let copyStatus = SecIdentityCreateWithCertificate(
	  nil,
	  certificate,
	  &identityInst
	)
	if copyStatus == errSecSuccess,
	   let identityInst = identityInst {
	  return identityInst
	}
	
	return nil
}
{% endhighlight %}

We also can use the `SecCertificateOIDs` header to fetch some specific data from a key-value collection of data provided by the certificate. Part of the data extracted from the certificate:

{% highlight json %}
Optional({
    "1.2.840.143635.100.6.1.12" =     {
        label = "1.2.840.113435.100.6.1.12";
        "localized label" = "1.2.840.113435.100.6.1.12";
        type = section;
        value =         (
                        {
                label = Critical;
                "localized label" = Critical;
                type = string;
                value = Yes;
            },
                        {
                label = "Unparsed Data";
                "localized label" = "Unparsed Data";
                type = data;
                value = {length = 2, bytes = 0x0500};
            }
        );
    };
    "2.5.4.3" =     {
        label = CN;
        "localized label" = CN;
        type = array;
        value =         (
            "Apple Development: Kyryl Horbushko (XXXXXXXX)"
        );
    };
    ... 
    // much more
{% endhighlight %}

What we need - this is a date. To get this, we can do the following:

{% highlight swift %}
  var expireAtDate: Date? {
    let data = SecCertificateCopyValues(certificate, nil, nil)
    let valueRaw = CFDictionaryGetValue(
      data,
      unsafeBitCast(kSecOIDX509V1ValidityNotAfter, to: UnsafeRawPointer.self)
    )
    let value = unsafeBitCast(
      valueRaw,
      to: NSDictionary.self
    )
    if let timeInterval = value["value"] as? TimeInterval {
      let date = Date(timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate: timeInterval)
      return date
    }

    return nil
  }

{% endhighlight %}

> I think there must be some type existing to cast a value not to `NSDictionary.self` but to it... but, didn't find it.

All the next - u can extend this type as u wish, adding more and more values via computed properties.

import Foundation

  var name: String? {

  var summary: String? {
    SecCertificateCopySubjectSummary(certificate) as? String

}

### fetch certificates

The first part is done. Now we must somehow fetch all the certificates from the keychain.

To do so, we can check [doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/certificates/getting_a_certificate) and see, that there is a function [SecItemCopyMatching(_:_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1398306-secitemcopymatching/) that can help us.

{% highlight swift %}
import Foundation
import Security
import Combine

final class KeychainCertificateExtractor {

  static func extractAllCertificates() -> [KeychainCertificate] {
    var certificates: [KeychainCertificate] = []

    var copyResult: CFTypeRef?
    let extractItemsErr = SecItemCopyMatching(
      [
        kSecClass: kSecClassIdentity,
        kSecMatchLimit: kSecMatchLimitAll,
        kSecReturnRef: true
      ] as NSDictionary,
      &copyResult
    )

    if extractItemsErr == errSecSuccess,
       let identities = copyResult as? [SecIdentity] {
      for identity in identities {
        var certificate: SecCertificate?
        let certCopyErr = SecIdentityCopyCertificate(identity, &certificate)
        if certCopyErr == errSecSuccess,
           let certificate = certificate {

          let certificate = KeychainCertificate(
            certificate: certificate
          )

          certificates.append(certificate)
        }
      }
    }

    return certificates
  }

  static func fetchAll() -> AnyPublisher<[KeychainCertificate], Never> {
    Deferred {
      Future { promise in
        let certs = Self.extractAllCertificates()
        promise(.success(certs))
      }
    }
    .eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### credentials

And last but not least part - use certificate as a credential in `URLSession`.

A sign can be done via `URLCredential` - the entity that is used by a delegate of `URLSession` and able to provide authentication info for it.


{% highlight swift %}
extension KeychainCertificate {
  var urlCredentials: URLCredential? {
    if let identity = identity {
      let credentials = URLCredential(
        identity: identity,
        certificates: [certificate],
        persistence: .forSession
      )
      return credentials
    }

    return nil
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Using these 3 step and crafting some UI, I got this:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-09-05-antumbra/ui.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-09-05-antumbra/ui.png" alt="design" width="600"/>
</a>
</div>

## conclusion

Always try to improve the process. This gives u at least 2 benefits - u learn something, u improve something.
