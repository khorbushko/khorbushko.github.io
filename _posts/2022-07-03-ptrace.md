What do we often think that debugging is? Is this just a bug fix? Let's check the definition of this word - according to [Oxford vocabularie](https://languages.oup.com/) its *the process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software*.
<!--more-->

But does it only this? As for me, this process is also a process of getting an understanding of how the software works, and what's going on under the hood.

To understand this, we must understand the mechanism of how we can debug some process - another process: [**ptrace** (**p**rocess **trace**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace#:~:text=ptrace%20is%20a%20system%20call,internal%20state%20of%20its%20target.).

## process

This service is used by different processes:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-07-03-ptrace/ptrace usage.png" alt="ptrace usage.png" width="300"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

To be more precise - this is a [system call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) - low-level service provided by the kernel, *the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system on which it is executed*.

In general, `ptrace` get all info about the process and as result, we can use it to read/write the memory and inspect and manipulate the process itself using various tools.

The definition:

{% highlight c %}
long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid,
                   void *addr, void *data);
{% endhighlight %}

We can open **/usr/include/sys/ptrace.h** and there we can found slightly modified declaration for Apple platforms:

{% highlight c %}
int ptrace(int _request, pid_t _pid, caddr_t _addr, int _data);
{% endhighlight %}

The difference, as u can see, it's a concrete type for `addr` and `_data`.

> U probably don't find any header file for iOS, thus this is not a part of a public API for iOS developers. To use `ptrace` we can obtain a pointer to it and after performing needed operations:
>
```
#import <sys/types.h>
#import typedef int (*ptrace_ptr_t)(int _request, pid_t _pid, caddr_t _addr, int _data);
void functionWithPtrace() {
    ptrace_ptr_t ptrace_ptr = (ptrace_ptr_t)dlsym(RTLD_SELF, "ptrace");
    ptrace_ptr(31, 0, 0, 0); // example call PT_DENY_ATTACH
}
```

## how it works

`ptrace` is used by some process (the *tracer*) to spy a *tracee* process only if the tracee permits it. To make it possible, the *tracee* must call `ptrace` itself (with correct arguments) to be "*traceable*".

## `ptrace` function

### `__ptrace_request`

The first argument `__ptrace_request` determines the behavior of ptrace and how other arguments are used.

### `pid`

Second argument - `PID`. The type is [`pid_t`](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/glibc-2.2.3/html_node/libc_554.html#:~:text=The%20pid_t%20data%20type%20is,Function%3A%20pid_t%20getppid%20(void)). The `pid_t` data type is a signed integer type which is capable of representing a process ID. In the GNU library, this is an int.

It's good to know that each process is named by a process ID number, a value of type `pid_t`. A process ID is allocated to each process when it is created. Process IDs are reused over time.

To find the process id on mac we can use `ps aux | grep -I <name>`.

This is an example of searching for PID for my editor for markdown:

```
ps aux | grep -i MacDown
khorbushko       26769   0,0  0,3 37026308  45032   ??  S    ср01    2:47.14 /Applications/MacDown.app/Contents/MacOS/MacDown
khorbushko       30524   0,0  0,0 408637584   1824 s001  S+   11:37     0:00.00 grep -i MacDown
```

more about [`ps`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html).

Alternative - `pgrep <name>` - just return pid:

```
pgrep MacDown
26769
```

### `void *addr` and `void *data`

This argument is sometimes used by the function. Actual usage depends from `__ptrace_request`.

For example:

`ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKTEXT, PID, addr, NULL)` - return a *WORD* read from the address `addr`, from the memory of the process `PID` (the tracee).

`data` is also dependent and can be used for obtaining some results from the function.

For example:

`ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, pid, NULL, &regs)` - copy a snapsot of the CPU's registers running the tracee (when it stopped), into a `user_regs_struct` structure (defined in `sys/user.h)`.

> examples I grab from [here](https://groogroot.eu/the-ptrace-system-call/)

## errors

Sometimes we can get an error from this function. To understand it we can use [`explain_ptrace`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/explain_ptrace).

```
const char *explain_ptrace(int request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data)
```

## PT_DENY_ATTACH

Apple also defines additional param for request value in the `ptrace` function. We can check [ptrace.h](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-792.13.8/bsd/sys/ptrace.h) with declaration for more info. One of these param is `PT_DENY_ATTACH` - disable lldb to attach to the selected process.

</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>


```
#define	PT_DENY_ATTACH	31
```

We can execute `ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, 0, 0, 0)` as result, attachment to process become very complicated.

I [answered some time ago on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39957583/2012219) to a question related to this code execution.

> For now, a few workarounds exist to bypass this, so don't rely on this. Read [more here](https://www.coredump.gr/articles/ios-anti-debugging-protections-part-1/) about them and [here](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Crack_prevention#PT_DENY_ATTACH) or [here](https://serializethoughts.com/2018/01/23/bypassing-anti-debugger-check-in-ios-applications).

A good alternative to `PT_DENY_ATTACH` in `ptrace` for protecting the app from being attached/debugged can be another system process - [`sysctl`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/sysctl.3.html). Repeatable checking of process state and detecting if the process has to debug attachment or no, can much better protect the app.

> [Example code](https://gist.github.com/rais38/4758465) that use `sysctl`

## Conclusion

`ptrace` very powerful tool that allows us to control and debug (using `debugserver`) the process. Unfortunately (?) it's not a silver bullet, but understanding this will help u to better debug and so provide quality code. 

`ptrace` is used by many tools and called all over the different processes in the system.
