Swift provides a lot of optimizations and swiftiness to our codebase and to the way how we can code and handle different cases. There are a lot of concepts, that help to make swiftiness real.

One of such concept - COW.
<!--more-->

> üêÇ Not the one that eats grass and can give u milk, but a principle/idea that can be constructed from first letters - Copy-On-Write.

This principle provides a copy-on-write semantic for types that use it. This means, that we can get some boost in terms of performance and memory usage, even with a lot of elements in it.

## The problem

Using values is fast and easy, but sometimes it may cost additional memory and performance. 

{% highlight swift %}
// imagine we have a lot of elements in array
let foo = [1,2,3, ... , n] 
let bar = foo
{% endhighlight %}

If we simply perform a copy, we need additional memory for placing all the elements and additional time to do so, so performance will be lost. 

But there are a lot of cases where u just need to pass an array (or another struct, array is just a sample) as a parameter to some function or for some iteration or to just have the same data in another obj. Do we need a copy in this case? The answer is no.

These cases are optimized and resolved thanks to copy-on-write semantics. This semantics can be used for any large value. The idea behind this is to do a copy only when we need it - when we edit the source.

That's all the idea - not always create a copy of value for the variable that was used during assigning.

## COW

Not all value types are coming with COW out of the box in Swift.

The COW is implemented as a feature for well-known data structures (array, dictionary, set) from the standard Swift library. This is done by Apple.

So, if u create a custom value type - this type doesn't have any implementation related to COW. But u can add it if u need this.

> As one of the samples how u can do this - [check Apple advice](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/OptimizationTips.rst#advice-use-copy-on-write-semantics-for-large-values)

The king of the process is [`isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/2429905-isknownuniquelyreferenced) function.

## Example

As always, a good example is worth 1000 words. The best way to inspect how everything needs to be implemented - is to check a source code. 

Let's inspect `URLRequest` class from `Foundation` framework. If u do so, u can find next:

{% highlight swift %}
@available(*, deprecated, message: "Please use the struct type URLRequest")
public typealias MutableURLRequest = NSMutableURLRequest

public struct URLRequest : ReferenceConvertible, Equatable, Hashable {
    public typealias ReferenceType = NSURLRequest
    public typealias CachePolicy = NSURLRequest.CachePolicy
    public typealias NetworkServiceType = NSURLRequest.NetworkServiceType
    
    /*
     NSURLRequest has a fragile Ivar layout that prevents the swift subclass approach here, so instead, we keep an always mutable copy
    */
    internal var _handle: _MutableHandle<NSMutableURLRequest>
    
    internal mutating func _applyMutation<ReturnType>(_ whatToDo : (NSMutableURLRequest) -> ReturnType) -> ReturnType {
        if !isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&_handle) {
            let ref = _handle._uncopiedReference()
            _handle = _MutableHandle(reference: ref)
        }
        return whatToDo(_handle._uncopiedReference())
    }
    
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

function `_applyMutation` is the heart of the process. U can see, that under the hood, Swift use obj-C class `NSMutableURLRequest` as a storage:

{% highlight swift %}
internal var _handle: _MutableHandle<NSMutableURLRequest>
{% endhighlight %}

In case we modify something in the `URLRequest` struct copy, the copy of the backed object is created.

## Custom type and COW

The steps that is needs to be done, to use COW in our custom type are next:

* create a kind of storage - a place where u'r data will be stored.  
* wrap to a struct, and use this storage under the hood
* on setting a new value / change, check with `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:)` to know if u needs to make a copy.

Here is a sample of data structure that uses COW - kind of [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO).

The FIFO idea:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-01-21-cow/fifo-lifo.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2022-01-21-cow/fifo-lifo.png" alt="fifo-lifo.png" width="350"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

> I didn't implement all functions needed for real [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO), because this is not important right now.

{% highlight swift %}
struct FIFO {

  final class Storage<Element> {
    var items: [Element] = []

    // MARK: - Lifecycle

    init() {}

    private init(_ items: [Element])  {
      self.items = items
    }

    // MARK: - Internal

    func add(_ item: Element)  {
      items.append(item)
    }

    func fetch() -> Element? {
      if items.isEmpty {
        return nil
      } else {
        return items.remove(at: 0)
      }
    }

    // MARK: - Copy

    func copy() -> Storage<Element> {
      Storage<Element>(items)
    }
  }

  private var _fifo = FIFO.Storage<Int>()

  mutating private func checkUniquelyReferencedInternalQueue() {
    if isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&_fifo) {
      debugPrint("reuse")
    } else {
      debugPrint("copied")
      _fifo = _fifo.copy()
    }
  }

  public mutating func put(_ item: Int) {
    checkUniquelyReferencedInternalQueue()
    _fifo.add(item)
  }

  public mutating func take() -> Int? {
    checkUniquelyReferencedInternalQueue()
    return _fifo.fetch()
  }

  mutating public func uniquelyReferenced() -> Bool {
    isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&_fifo)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

</p>
</details>
<br>

If u test the code above, u will see a message 

{% highlight swift %}
"copied"
{% endhighlight %}

as soon as u execute line `fifo2.put(2)`.

> Of cause, I can just use array as storage and this will give me COW for free, but the idea is to show the possible implementation of the COW in a custom data structure.
