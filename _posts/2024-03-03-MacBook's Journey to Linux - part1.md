Recently I faced a task, that required me usage of Linux. I'm not a very experienced user of this OS, so I spent some time investigating this question. 
<!--more-->

I have only my old MacBookPro14,3 that can be used for installation and running Linux. Due to the task, the preferred distributive of Linux is Debian.
As a result, I decided to note every step I took, to make this happen.

## Installation of a second OS to MacBook

As I mentioned above, I have only an old Macbook, that can be used for this. At the same moment I use that PC, so some files and other stuff are present there. So the only option for me was to install Linux on the same machine.

To make this happen I need to perform a few steps:

- grab part of hard drive space for a new system
- modify the system boot mechanism to allow boot selection
- prepare installation image
- install the system

A pretty easy task at first look, but the devil is in the details.

### Disk partition

We need to use some separate disk partitions for the new OS. 

To do so, we can use a great build utility on Mac - DiskUtility. I won't cover the full process of how to do that, instead - [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/disk-utility/dskutl14027/mac) is the perfect tutorial from Apple related to this.

The only moment that I want to mention - during this process, I got some errors and needed to switch to recovery mode and complete the process interruption there - during partition the process was unable to complete. Thus this is not an undoable process, always remember that it's a bit risky.

<div style="text-align:center">

</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

> As I mentioned above, I have some data on my Mac and I did everything with the knowledge, that I could lose everything in case of error, but it's better to make a copy before u start.

A few moments that need to be remembered:

- backup data that is present on the disk
- for Linux, u need at least 30GB for decent installation (I created a disk with 35 GB)

Parameters for DiskUtility: 

- Name: anything u like, 
- Format: OS X Extended (Journaled)
- Size: 30+ GB (keep in mind that some parts of this space can be used by Linux for swap).

As a result, I got a divided hard drive:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/disk.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/disk.png" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

In this image, u can see that I have a Macintosh (for MacOS), disk0s3 - system Linux, small partition with asterisks * - swap area for Linux.

### Modify the system boot mechanism to allow boot selection

To be able to load different systems we should somehow be able to select a boot start point. To do so, we can use [rEFInd](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) - a great tool designed specifically for this purpose.

> Note, that the process below may harm your pc, so be ready ;]

The very first thing that needs to be - noted, is that I have an old Mac - MacBookPro14,3 with arch x86_64 - this means that all steps and approaches applicable only to this kind of arch, for M1 need to use a different approach.

To set rEFInd u need to do the following:

- disable [System Integrity Protection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection):
	- boot in recovery mode (CMD+R during Mac start)
	- execute `csrutil disable`
	- boot anch check `csrutil status` - should be `System Integrity Protection status: disabled.`

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/csrutil.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/csrutil.png" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

U can also use [`diskutil list`](https://ss64.com/mac/diskutil.html) command to inspect u'r drive:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/diskutils.jpg">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/diskutils.jpg" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

- mount EFI partition:
	- run `mkdir /Volumes/ESP`
	- run `mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP`
- create directory `REFIND`
	- `mkdir REFIND` at the EFI volume -> `/EFI/REFIND`
- from the [rEFInd archive](https://refit.sourceforge.net) grab files and copy them into just created dir `REFIND`
	- `refind/drivers_x64/`
	- `refind/icons/`
	- `refind/refind_x64.efi`
	- `refind/tools_x64/`
- grab **config** example, rename it to `refind.conf`, and copy it to just the created dir `REFIND`
- [bless](https://ss64.com/mac/bless.html) the new created partition with rEFInd using `bless --mount /Volumes/ESP --setBoot --file /Volumes/ESP/EFI/REFIND/refind_x64.efi --shortform`


<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/bless.jpg">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/bless.jpg" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

> Note some commands require `sudo`

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/done.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/done.png" alt="disk" width="600"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Restart u'r Mac, u should be able to see rEFInd screen:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/rEFIndScreen.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/rEFIndScreen.png" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Huh.. done for now.

---
After reading docs and googling around I found a perfect guide for this [here](https://gist.github.com/rowanphipps/e4c0e6037b71e9ea96dd8fe403461ee3), so maybe u should look at also.

There is a good moment described - after u install a new system, the blessing disappears from Refind, so u need to repeat the `bless`. To do so, u can use a small script:

```
#!/bin/bash
mkdir /Volumes/ESP
mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP
bless --mount /Volumes/ESP --setBoot --file /Volumes/ESP/EFI/REFIND/refind_x64.efi --shortform
```

## Prepare installation image

To make a bootable stick u need to do a few things:

- obtain an image of the OS u want to install
- flash stick with that image

### Obtain an image of the OS u want to install

As I mentioned earlier, I need a Debian system, but u may use any u like. To select an image - go to [official web](https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/#stable) page and select dedicated architecture under stable releases.

> To check which arch is u'r - `uname -p`.

In my case, I selected [this](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/) image.

Now, we need to create a bootable stick. This process involves a few steps also:

- download and prepare `.iso` file - done as described above
- convert the `.iso` file into a `.img.dmg`. To do so, we can use [`hdiutil convert`](https://ss64.com/mac/hdiutil.html)

```
khb@MacBook-Pro-kyryl ~ % hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o linux1.img /Users/khb/Downloads/debian-12.5.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso  
Reading Master Boot Record (MBR : 0)â€¦
Reading Debian 12.5.0 amd64 n            (Apple_ISO : 1)â€¦
..................................................................................................................................
Reading  (Type EF : 2)â€¦
...................................................................................................................................
Elapsed Time: 75799.157ms
Speed: 658.6MB/s
Savings: 0.0%
created: /Users/khb/linux1.img.dmg
```

- identify the flash drive, using [`diskutils list`](https://ss64.com/mac/diskutil.html):

```
khb@MacBook-Pro-kyryl ~ % diskutil list                                                          
/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0
   1:             Apple_APFS_ISC Container disk1         524.3 MB   disk0s1
   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk3         494.4 GB   disk0s2
   3:        Apple_APFS_Recovery Container disk2         5.4 GB     disk0s3

....

/dev/disk8 (external, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.1 GB     disk8
   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED                2.1 GB     disk8s1
```
As u can see, in my case the name of the disk - `disk8`.

- unmount disk for flashing `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk8`:

```
khb@MacBook-Pro-kyryl ~ % diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk8
Unmount of all volumes on disk8 was successful
```

- copy dmg to flash drive:

```
khb@MacBook-Pro-kyryl ~ % time sudo dd if=/Users/khb/Downloads/linux.img.dmg of=/dev/disk8 bs=1m                                 
3808+0 records in
3808+0 records out
3992977408 bytes transferred in 241.202992 secs (16554427 bytes/sec)
sudo dd if=/Users/khb/Downloads/linux.img.dmg of=/dev/disk8 bs=1m  0.02s user 6.89s system 2% cpu 4:04.80 total
```

> Note, that the last operation can take some time.

I also found a very useful guide with 3rd party tool [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.io/). The downside of this - is that this tool asks u for u'r root password without a system popup, but it works a bit faster than the approach described above.

The complete guide is here: [Create a bootable USB stick on macOS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview)

Note: if u select incorrect arch - when u boot, rEFIt will not show u anything in the menu. If everything is ok, u will see an additional installation menu on the next boot of u'r Mac:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/bootMenu.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/bootMenu.png" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

### Install the system

The last part of this story - Debian installation ;]. Now we just need to go through installation and we are good to go. Pretty easy.

The pitfall is next - some hardware is not recognized and so not workable during this process, so u need an additional mouse and keyboard and also a USB-C to USB-A adapter. Also note, that only 2 USB-C ports are working (active one).

I didn't know that, so was not prepared - as a result, I had wait to until the morning so I could buy a mouse and keyboard and complete the installation.

Note, also wifi, audio, video, and some other stuff are dead, so u can't connect to them until u complete the installation.

> Later I found a workaround for wifi - just create a fresh access point on u'r phone and connect to it - after that, u can connect to other networks - not sure about the reason.

</div>
<br>
<br>

If u interested in a detailed guide to the Debian GUI installation wizard - [here is one of many](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-debian-10-buster) that u can find.

The most tricky moment here - is the part related to the hard disk. Previously we already created it and configured the file system, but, as u remember, I mentioned that Linux may use a swap disk for better performance. So the best choice here - is to erase the newly created partition on the disk and to allow the installation wizard to perform the partition with automatic swap space configuration.

When u done, reloading Mac, u will be redirected to the Linux system, so u need to perform rebless (as described earlier, above).

After rebless, my system looks like this:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/rEFIndWithOSXandDebian.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/rEFIndWithOSXandDebian.png" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

And the loaded Debian:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/system.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2024-03-03-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part1/system.png" alt="disk" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

## Problems

Of course, as I expect, some hardware is not working. The problem list contains the following items:

- [wifi]({% post_url 2024-03-04-MacBooks Journey to Linux - part2 %})
- [audio]({% post_url 2024-03-14-MacBook's Journey to Linux - part 4 %})
- video

In the next articles, I will cover how to fix these problems to make u'r Debian shine.
