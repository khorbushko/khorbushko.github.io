Representing information in graphical mode can simplify its recognition and processing for humans dramatically. For this purpose, we have a lot of options, and one of the most popular is charts. 

In mobile apps, charts are also present - the more we move forward, the more often we can see them.
<!--more-->

Previously, if we wanted to use some charts or simple graphs, we had to draw them manually - no system components were present. Now, with `SwiftUI`, this can be done very easily, thanks to the [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts) framework.

Let's taste the new [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts) frameworks and see what can be done within.


## Before

As I mention, previosly it was a hard and long work to produce nice-controllable and efficient chart on iOS platform - using a lot of [`CALayers`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer), [`responder chain`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/using-responders-and-the-responder-chain-to-handle-events), [`CAAnimation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/caanimation) with other techniques (for example [`CATileLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/catiledlayer)) can provide a nice result, but the downside of this process was always present - u need a lot of time for this.

As an example, let me show u a code screenshot from a project from far 2015 - where my colleague and I developed a small chart with a schedule. Despite the chart is small, it's supports some interactions and other components, so a lot of work needs to be done manually, and a class for moving point can easely contain a 800 lines (with a lot of reused code), a lot of aspects needs to be controller manually, for example few lines for creating shaking "x" button on top of layer with Schedule element:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/example.png">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/example.png" alt="example.png" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

## Now

Now, with [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts), this would take, I don't know, 30 lines of code:


{% highlight swift %}

Chart(dataPoints) { point in
    LineMark(
        x: .value("X-value", point.x),
        y: .value("Y-value", point.y)
    )
    .foregroundStyle(.blue)

    PointMark(
        x: .value("X-value", point.x),
        y: .value("Y-value", point.y)
    )
}
.chartOverlay { proxy in
    GeometryReader { geometry in
        Rectangle()
            .fill(Color.clear)
            .contentShape(Rectangle())
            .gesture(
                DragGesture()
                    .onChanged { value in
                        let origin = geometry[proxy.plotAreaFrame].origin
                        let location = CGPoint(
                            x: value.location.x - origin.x,
                            y: value.location.y - origin.y
                        )
                        let (x, y) = proxy.value(
	                        at: location, 
	                        as: (Double, Double).self
	                        ) ?? (0, 0)
                        if let closestPoint = nearestPoint(to: (x, y)) {
                            selectedPoint = closestPoint
                            updateSelectedPointPosition(x: x, y: y)
                        }
                    }
                    .onEnded { _ in
                        selectedPoint = nil
                    }
            )
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}


<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo_chart.gif">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo_chart.gif" alt="demo_chart.gif" width="300"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

And also, it's very customizable. Nice.

### Examples

What can be done within [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts) framework? 

Heh - I guess 90% of u'r needs: [`Bars`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/barmark), [`Lines`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/linemark), [`Pies`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/sectormark), [`Plot`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/lineplot) (even a custom one! - in [official example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/creating-a-data-visualization-dashboard-with-swift-charts) it's a map). For doing such things before, we should did almost everything by ourselves:

-  approximation of points
-  drawing custom shape with `Path`
-  managing every interaction
-  updating and populating data
-  even primitive animations

Yes, a lot of power (and we still can do this with `SwiftUI`, on purpose), but it's nice to have an easier approach that can be used when u just need something simple.

> At the moment of writing [`Chart3D`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/chart3d) is also available as beta, so even more power to this tool

For now, all the above sounds like an advertisement, but it's probably a good work that should be known by everyone.

I play a bit more with [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts) framework, and want to show u results:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo2.gif">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo2.gif" alt="demo_chart.gif" width="150"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo1.gif">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo1.gif" alt="demo_chart.gif" width="300"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>


<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo3.gif">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo3.gif" alt="demo_chart.gif" width="300"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>


and more...

### Animation

As always, we can work a bit with data and the way it can be built and combined, and add some nice small animations:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo3.gif">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/images/2025-09-15-charts-in-swiftui/demo_anim.gif" alt="demo_chart.gif" width="300"/>
</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

The code itself is very simple, but the effect - much better than a non-animated reload:

{% highlight swift %}

private func onDataChange(_ newValue: [DataModel]) {
    animationTask?.cancel()

    animationTask = Task {
        await MainActor.run {
            animatedData = []
        }

        let batchSize = 4
        var currentIndex = 0

        while currentIndex < newValue.count && !Task.isCancelled {
            let endIndex = min(currentIndex + batchSize, newValue.count)
            let batch = Array(newValue[currentIndex..<endIndex])

            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 30_000_000)

            await MainActor.run {
                withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.1)) {
                    animatedData.append(contentsOf: batch)
                }
            }

            currentIndex = endIndex
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

You can easily extend or change the behaviour. 

> Be careful - using an approach above for a HUGE amount of dataPoints will freeze a bit UI - u need to adjust the logic; this way is only good for a small data batch, up to a few hundred. 
> 
> As I sad - it's just a demonstaration, how small amount of work can improve things.

### Key moments

* Be sure that your data well strucutred and u know what u have and what u want to show
* Define correctly `Domain` for u'r data for `X` and `Y` scale. The correct domain can dramatically improve performance.
* Use [`drawingGroup`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/drawinggroup(opaque:colormode:)) for better performance
* Gestures require a bit advanced understanding of [coordinate system](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/CoordinateSpaceProtocol) and how to interract with it (`.global`, `.local`, and `.named(_:)`). `.chartOverlay` and `GeometryReader` - are the best frieds here (see example at the beginning)
* If u think, that something not possible to draw with current API - think from different angle or/and introspect, analyze and implement. [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts) has its limitations, but usually, we can work around them. U can also combine [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts) with [`Canvas`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/canvas) - 

<details><summary> similar implementation of movable points as in the example above, but with Canvas </summary>
<p>

{% highlight swift %}

Canvas { context, size in
    for i in 0...5 {
        let y = size.height - (CGFloat(i) * size.height / 5)
        context.stroke(
            Path { p in
                p.move(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: y))
                p.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: size.width, y: y))
            },
            with: .color(.gray.opacity(0.2)),
            lineWidth: 1
        )
    }
    
    var path = Path()
    if let firstPoint = points.first {
        path.move(to: firstPoint)
        for point in points.dropFirst() {
            path.addLine(to: point)
        }
    }
    context.stroke(
        path,
        with: .color(.blue),
        lineWidth: 2
    )
    
    for (index, point) in points.enumerated() {
        let circlePath = Path(ellipseIn: CGRect(
            x: point.x - 10,
            y: point.y - 10,
            width: 20,
            height: 20
        ))
        
        context.fill(
            circlePath,
            with: .color(.blue)
        )
        context.stroke(
            circlePath,
            with: .color(.white),
            lineWidth: 2
        )
    }
}

* Think about accessability for u'r [`Charts`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts)
* Check [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/visualizing_your_app_s_data) [examples](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/creating-a-data-visualization-dashboard-with-swift-charts) for details


## Conclusion

It's always interesting to check new frameworks, especially when they're well-designed. Look and learn how to not only use a framework, but also how an API for such functionality can be organized, how different components may be combined.
