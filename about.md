I like coding, love it when development is done right. Always looking for new opportunities to learn something new and interesting. 

I'm an expert in mobile application development mainly for the iOS platform. Has strong analytical and troubleshooting skills. Fluent with agile methodologies, full SDLC, software design principles, and approaches. Has a strong understanding of the best practices for technical architecture and clean code. A high analytical and curious mind, result-oriented, and nothing-is-impossible mindset. Keeps up with the latest technologies.

Sometimes codding is my passion, sometimes a hobby, and sometimes just a job. 

Hope my notes can help someone.
Enjoy your coding :]
